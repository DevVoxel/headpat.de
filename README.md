# The Headpat Website - Next.js 14

## How to contribute

You want to help? Great. Here's how you can do that:
Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. If you don't know how to do
that, [here's a guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

## Code of Conduct

We work with short and simple rules:
Name the branch after the type of PR you're working on (e.g. `feat/feature-name` or `fix/bug-name`). This will
help us to keep track of what's going on.

## How to run the website locally

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### NOTE:

Most pages require API Keys to work. If you require an API Key, please contact Faye.

#### Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying the homepage. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.
